# Traffic-sign-classification

# Project Objective: 
1. Computer vision's fascinating study of traffic sign classification is crucial for the development of autonomous car technologies. 
2. If self-driving cars are to become prevalent on future roadways, reliable and real-time traffic sign detecting algorithms must be used. With the help of the training dataset, our system will be able to classify the images of the various traffic signs that are posted on the roadways. 
3. The primary goal is to categorize, identify, and recognize traffic signs using convolutional neural networks, which are composed of neurons with learnable weights and biases that help in providing high performance in identifying the traffic signs even in their challenging and vulnerable circumstances.
